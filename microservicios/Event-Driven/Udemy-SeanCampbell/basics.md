# Basics

* Microservices should not share code or data
* Avoid unnecessary coupling between services and software components
* Independence and autonomy are more important than code re-usability
* Each microservice shold be responsible for a single system function or process
* Microservcies should not communicate directly with each other. They should make use of an event/message bus to communicate with one another
